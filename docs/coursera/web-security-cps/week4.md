* Safety
* **Security**
* Usabillity
* Sustainabillity
* Interoperabilliy
* Design Validation
* Physical Interction Modeling

### Need for CPS Security

* Environment Coupling
    * lack of isolation
* Resource-constrained
Second, cyber-physical systems can be composed of a very large number of
different devices with different computing platforms and capabilities.
In general, most devices in cyber physical systems are resource constrained,
meaning that they don't have much processing,
storage, or power capacity to execute complex operations. 
* Networked at multiple and extreme scales
* High degrees of automation


## CPS Security Requirements

* Sensing Security
    Validity and accuracy of sensed da is very important
* Storage Security
    Against any unauthorized access and modification
* Communication Security
* Actuation Control Security
    All actuations are authorized and according to he latest policies of the system
* Feedback Security
    Needs to b appropriately protected against tempering attempts
* Application Specific Security Requirements

## CPS Security Solutions

* Multi-domain primitives
    * Enviroment (Physical Security)
    * Cyber Security
* Security by desing

The system need to be designed to detect anormal physical conditions, and
act in a safe way in these situations.

Also, the system should always be protected against physical tampering
whenever possible.

This can be achieved by continuous testing and careful design of rigorous
authentication solutions and hardware and software components of the system.
