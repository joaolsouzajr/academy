## Introduction to Cryptography

### Types of Cipher System

* Symmetric]
    * decryption key =  encryption key 

* Public or Asymmetric
    * decryption key != encryption key
    * decryption key is privete
    * encryption key is public

### Stream Chipers

* Plaintext is encrypted bit by bit or byte by byte
The same key stream is then used for
decryption on the receiver side in the similar manner.

The key streams are generated as random or pseudo-random digits.

So, the security of a stream cipher is highly dependent
on the key stream generation process.
Stream ciphers are small and fast, and
that's why they are suitable for embedded resource constrain devices

### Block Ciphers

* Fixed size of plain text
* Encrypting large data
    * Data Encryption Standard or DEC
    * Triple DES
    * Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
* Different modes of Operation
    * Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB)
    * Cipher Chanining Mode (CBC)
    * Eletronic Code Block (ECB)

### Attack model

* Breaking Algorithm
    * Ciphertext-only
    * Known-plaintext
    * Chosen-plaintext
    * Chosen-ciphertext
* Exhaustive Key Search
* Perfect Secrecy
* Desing Principle
    * Cover period
