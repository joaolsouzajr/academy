1. Where were Solar cells first produced?
The first solar cell was created at Bell Labs in New Jersey

2. Which country has the most PV on a per-capita basis?
Germany has the most solar PV on a per-capita basis.

3. Cloudy days still produce significant PV Energy ?
True. Correct! Solar energy is still falling to earth on cloudy days. 

4. Discarded PV modules are hazardous to the environment.
Correct! PV modules do not contain hazardous chemicals.

The "Net Metering" incentive "banks" your excess energy with the utility.
Correct! Energy producers receive a credit for energy that is sent back to the grid.




What country has installed the most PV? 

Although Germany leads in PV per capita, China has the most installed PV. 

Batteries:

* can supply a steady source of electricity.
* reduce use of Natural Gas Peaking plants.
* can "shave" electrical demand peaks.

PV Modules use **aluminum, silicon and copper**.

The net metering incentive is valued at the standard per kWh rate. (T/F)

True

Energy producers earn credits at their standard rate, and these can be used at times when there is little or no sun. 

Between 2015 and 2020, what was the largest United States PV market segment ? 

**Utility** scale applications made up the vast majority of PV installations in the United States between 2015 and 2020.


About how much solar energy does the earth’s land surface receive annually? 

200,000 Trillion KWh

Keep in mind that this figure is for the earth’s land surface only and does not include all of the energy falling on our oceans. 


Question 8

Wind Power is very site specific. (T/F)

True

Solar PV offers more flexibility than wind turbines in terms of location.  

Question 9

Select the response that presents the solar history events in the correct order.


1. B: Solar cell developed by Bell Labs
2. A: Solar cells used widely on spacecraft
3. D: China entered solar market
4. C: Price of solar cells decreased due to mass production


Select all solar energy incentives from the list below. 

* Net metering
* Cash rebates
* Accelerated depreciation
* Tax credits
