# Embedded System

 An embedded system is a microcomputer with mechanical, chemical, or electrical devices attached to it, programmed for a specific dedicated purpose, and packaged up as a complete system.

**Embedded Microcomputer System**

* **Embedded** means hidden inside so one canâ€™t see it. 
* **Micro** means small, and a **computer** contains a processor, memory, and a means to exchange data with the external world. 
* **System** means multiple components interfaced together for a common purpose.

**Microcontrollers**, which are microcomputers incorporating the processor, 
RAM, ROM and I/O ports into a single package, are often employed in an 
embedded system because of their low cost, small size, and low power requirements.
