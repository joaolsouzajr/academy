Clock speed is measured by how many ticks per second the clock makes. The unit of measurement called a hertz (Hz), which is technically one cycle per second, is used to measure clock speed. In the case of computer clock speed, one hertz equals one tick per second. The clock speed of computers is usually measured in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz). 

* One megahertz equals one million ticks per second
* One gigahertz equals one billion ticks per second.

1 Hz = 1
1 KHz = 1000
1 MHz = 1000000
1 GHz = 1000000000

Ex.: 80 MHz = 80000000

1 000_000_000 ns / 80_000_000 ticks = 12.5 ns per tick

80000000 - 1s
x - 1/1000
