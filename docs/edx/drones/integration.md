    [Matt Scassero, Director, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Test Site, University of Maryland] So the integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the National Airspace has a lot of different aspects to it. There's technological aspects, there's
    societal aspects, and there's the economic impacts, and each of them have pros and cons, challenges and opportunities.
    From the very get go, you really have to describe it as a
    crawl, walk, run, kind of mentality and that's not just the FAA approach. It should be everybody's approach.
    There's a lot of people that want to jump full in, both feet, the heck with the parachute. Let's just go.
    It's aviation. So you do have to think about that.
    And I would even say that in many ways with, especially with the FAA,
    it's a crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl, walk, run kind of mentality, but for a good - very good reason.
    Aviation is based on safety case analysis.
    You have to create the safety case that says the way we are planning on doing it with this aircraft is
    safer than the alternative, the way we've been doing it, either with manned aircraft, or when we didn't use aircraft.
    So the safety case has to prove that what we're trying to do is better and
    safer than the way we used to do it.
    So that's kind of the bottom line that you have to start with with integration.
    The way the FAA is approaching it is a very collaborative
    affair.
    Working with industry from the Googles, the Amazons, the FedEx, UPS, the Airlines, everybody down to research sites and
    colleges and universities and schools,
    to bring in the technological
    expertise.
    They're bringing in all these pieces and figuring out, what do we need to do? What are the requirements?
    What are the technologies required to answer those requirements? What are the societal impacts? And bottom line,
    what are the regulatory methods we have to regulate?
    We are probably the only industry in the world right now that's wanting to be regulated and that goes to the economic piece.
    We can't make money with drones until they're regulated. So Part 107 is out there. They're very small, low altitude.
    So the wedding photographers, the real estate photographers, the insurance roof inspectors, are all starting to use them to do better work,
    but also make money doing them. But you can't do package delivery
    if you can't be a go beyond visual line of sight. You can't do large-scale internet capabilities, if you can't fly over people.
    There's things you can't do without the regulations that authorize you to do those things. So we have to get those regulations in place.
    The methodology at the FAA is using via that crawl, walk, run mentality is they're starting small.
    They started with Part 107 just to get an idea of what people were going to do, where they were going to do it.
    We actually flew as a test site for two years under that rule set before it became a rule set.
    So the things that we're now doing - both as a [UAS] Test Site,
    but also Part 107 operators that are doing waivers and exemptions to Part 107 -
    that will be the next rule set for flying over people, flying beyond visual line of sight, flying larger aircraft.
    So we're starting to work into that - things like LAANC, the Low Altitude
    [Authorization and Notification] Capability.
    Being able to figure out where we can fly around airports, under Part
    107 authorizations is another step. The next big step is UTM - UAS Traffic Management.
    And that's being worked by FAA and NASA in conjunction with lots of partners - over a hundred partners of
    technology, industry, universities, all different kinds of people.
    And they're doing use cases of how do we do this? And the use cases
    they're starting with are small UAS, low altitude
    but then, in certain environments: over people,
    beyond visual line of sight, in urban environments. And they're pulling together all the pieces and one of the things they are really
    concentrating on is USS - UAS Service Suppliers.
    Who are the companies that are going to create the software and the algorithms and the actual hardware to run these systems to control,
    not only unmanned aircraft, but manned aircraft?
    How are they aware of what the manned aircraft are, that are out there, both cooperative targets that are reporting their locations,
    but also the uncooperative targets that are just not required to report but you still need to know where they are.
    How are you aware of the urban infrastructure, buildings? What are the sense and avoid, the detect and avoid requirements?
    What are those systems going to be that incorporate those things into a UTM's system that will be the air traffic control of the future?
    Everybody knows that whatever we come up with can't be just unmanned aircraft. It has to work with manned and unmanned aircraft together.
    So the white sheet of paper, future view way down the line, is that everything is computer-controlled.
    It's all part of one big massive system and everybody's
    omniscient and self aware of themselves and everybody else all the time, 100%, no failures. Until we get there,
    it's going to be a phased approach, looking at very small use cases,
    expanding them out to link the use cases together to do them over larger areas.
    And then be able to eventually get them to a point where we can fly unmanned systems and manned systems in
    environments like urban environments, like over people, like beyond visual line of sight, that then enables our economic use cases.
    It allows us to do the applications that we can use drones in those environments over people,
    beyond visual line of sight, to do
    economically efficient operations. One of the things people are focusing on now are, is what can the drone do?
    The better question is, what should the drone do? What does the business market
    economic case say it should be doing?
    There's a lot of folks out there that talk about package delivery to the doorstep.
    The business model doesn't exist for that and probably will never exist for that because of a lot of different reasons.
    Transportation infrastructure - things like that. But there will be
    market and business cases for
    distribution centers, rural area deliveries - things like that where it makes a lot of sense to use drones for that.
    So it'll be a matter of creating those business cases that make sense and
    then creating the rules and regulations that allow those. And that's why industry is such a big partner in the whole UTMs
    process because they're the ones that are actually helping to define the
    use cases that the public is going to want to use but are also economically viable. And then we'll create the
    regulations and put those in place to be able to do that.
