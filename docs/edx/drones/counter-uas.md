    [Matt Scassero, Director, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Test Site, University of Maryland] With any new technology, there are gonna people that are gonna misuse that
    technology, or try to interfere with our ability to use the new technology. So
    there's really kind of two aspects to that. One is the people that are trying
    to interfere. Whether, it's taking control of our aircraft and taking the aircraft,
    or maybe taking control of the payload and making it look in places we don't
    want it to look, or just making it worthless, or stealing our package during
    the package delivery aspect, or when our burrito gets delivered to us - stealing
    our burrito. So that comes down to cybersecurity. And there's so many
    different aspects, so it's really not something I'm going to get into detail
    on because I can't. It's not my expertise area but cybersecurity is a big aspect.
    I've made the analogy many times - these are nothing more than flying laptops and
    you can hack a laptop. You can hack these. Which will be one of the things we talk
    about in the counter UAS area. But cybersecurity takes a lot of different
    forms. There's very easy forms. There's very difficult forms, and it's really
    dependent on what the threat is that you're trying to do - combat. If it's a
    state player that's a dedicated attacker, or a hacker that's really cutting edge
    technology-wise, you're going to have to have that layer and that
    defense-in-depth layered defense kind of approach, where it's not just one thing
    that's protecting you. There's some very simple fixes out there - simple encryption,
    plug-and-play encryption. We work with a company in Israel called Regulus that
    does very simple plug-and-play encryption. It is very, very effective and
    it's very flexible because all you need to do is plug it in - module on the
    aircraft, module on the ground control station, module at every radio node and
    you're good to go. You have instant cybersecurity. So cybersecurity is one
    aspect of it. On the other side is what happens when somebody decides to use drones
    for nefarious purposes - whether it's a state player, or ISIS, a terrorist
    organization, or just criminals, or people trying to drop contraband into a prison?
    So counter UAS is a huge area and it became huge
    as soon as drones became huge because they knew people would immediately start
    misusing them. Counter UAS is actually the exact same thing as the
    military air defense problem. And it's a defense-in-depth and it's a layered
    approach to it. You have detection, location,
    identification, tracking, engagement, and then after egagement - post engagement
    activities. With drones, you need to be able to detect them. They're hard to
    detect. They're very small. A lot of them don't have a lot of metallic components,
    so radar is very tough to find them with unless you're using something like a
    bird radar. The acoustics aren't really evident until they get very close, so
    there's a lot of different challenges to just being able to detect these things,
    especially when you get down to small or even smaller drones - you know that gnat
    size, fly size kind of thing I mentioned earlier. So detection is a big idea, a big
    problem. Then location - once you've detected - identifying exactly where it
    is, that's a little bit easier once you find it but it still has some challenges.
    Identification is a huge issue. Is it a good guy? A bad guy? Who's good guy? Who's
    bad guy is it? There's some different ways to approach that. One of the biggest
    things the FAA and Congress are pushing for is part of the FAA Reauthorization
    Act of 2018, is remote ID. And in most people's minds, it's an RF ID of some
    sort - radio frequency, transponder or beacon that would identify that
    particular aircraft - what it is, who owns it
    where, what it's doing that kind of thing. So that's at the very simple level. A lot
    of different ideas on how to do that right now, but it is one of the ideas. So
    that's a cooperative target - somebody that doesn't mind being identified is
    gonna have that, but the nefarious people aren't gonna self ID. They're gonna
    disable those kind of things, and be able to remove those kind of things. So the
    identification is a very critical aspect. A lot of it is based on behavior. If
    you're a nuclear power plant and somebody's flying a drone directly at your
    nuclear power plant, there's a behavioral aspect of that. That they're probably
    either clueless or they're trying to do something against your site. If you're a
    prison and somebody flies a drone inside of a perimeter of your prison, they're
    probably trying to either see something or drop something. So behavior becomes a
    lot - a big piece of the identification part of the puzzle. And then there's
    aspects of technical identification. What kind of signals are being transmitted to
    and from the aircraft, as well as the ground control station?
    What kind of signatures do the propellers make? Excuse me, what kind of signatures,
    do the propellers make? As they spin, they create a signature that is different for
    different components and different companies. So there's a lot of different
    ways to do that. And then the engagement, runs everything from broad jamming where
    it just disables everything that's in the air at a certain frequency just
    barrage jamming, down to very specific jamming against a very specific system,
    against a very specific component of the system. Not being able to hack into the
    system. That's actually the most effective counter UAS technology today - is
    being able hack directly into the system. What that requires is some knowledge of
    how the system works. So some of the earliest systems needed to know what
    system they were going against, but some of the later systems now go against an
    architecture. A drone has to operate in certain ways and there's only a few auto
    pilots that are out there that people generally use so they go after those
    particular components. And then you have kinetic engagement whether it's shooting
    a net gun, shooting nerf balls or shooting bullets. There's goods to that -
    that they can be very effective, depending on the type of system being
    involved, but they can also be very ineffective. It's really tough to shoot
    these things down. They're so small from any kind of range. Plus you have that
    idea of that bullet. It's still traveling out there if you miss. So kinetic has its
    pros but also its cons of what are the collateral damage might be as well as
    just the effectiveness of being able to take care of it. And the final one is -
    once you have it, if you have a net gun, something like that, where is it going to
    come down? If you jam it, barrage jam it or disables it, the kinetic engagement, whatever -
    it's going to just drop. What's it going to drop on? Maybe you want to keep that
    platform. Maybe it has a chemical payload of some sort that you really don't want
    to just have drop. You want to actually grab it and take it someplace. So there
    are systems out there now that capture it. Another company called Airspace out of
    California has a system where they actually capture and then you can fly it
    away with your drone to another location. Now some of the hacking systems can
    actually direct the aircraft to go fly to a different location. So the concern
    runs everywhere from the Department of Defense is trying to protect our troops
    overseas, from terrorists, or other state players, all the way to, in this country -
    NFL, NASCAR, Major League Soccer trying to protect those big open air venues that
    are very susceptible to chemical, biological, radiological,
    attacks. And then prisons. Probably the earliest target of
    opportunity for people using drones in a bad way here in the United States
    has been dropping contraband into prisons. So a lot of different people
    want to break this nut, solve this challenge and just a lot of good work
    going on and we're doing some of the research on that here at the test site.
    [Ryan Henderson, UAS Pilot, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Test Site University of Maryland] Yes, so some of the operations and missions that we've done with counter UAS
    involved being able to use various radar systems to identify, you know, an aircraft
    out there. And it's not necessarily counter UAS at all times. It could just
    be identifying that versus a bird or something else that's small in the air -
    smaller than a regular manned aircraft. There have been bird radar systems out
    for many, many years but now with this new technology and industry, we're
    starting to figure out how to change the algorithm in those radars to understand
    the difference between a bird and a drone. And maybe not just a drone but
    what kind is it? How fast is it going? How high? What direction? So we've had great
    opportunity to work with some companies and further that technology.
