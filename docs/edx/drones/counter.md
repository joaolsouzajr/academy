The most popular drone detection techniques are radar, radio frequency (RF) detection, electro-optical (EO) which detects drones based on their visual signature, and infrared (IR) sensors that detect heat signatures. The most effective interdiction technique is jamming.  This disrupts the radio frequency link between the drone and its operator by generating large volumes of RF output.

Another technique is spoofing, which takes control of the targeted drone by hijacking the communications link.  Since this is a new market, there is a lack of standardization and variance in effectiveness and reliability.  But the growth in the counter-drone technology sector is directly related to drone breaches and unauthorized disruption.

The private sector is designing new, integrated COTS drone detection and jamming systems to defend and counter potentially dangerous, intrusions into airport airspace. This entails a combined detection and jamming system.  For example, the company Dedrone is building a system that provides an integrated early warning alert system that meshes data from sensors, video cameras, and radars.  Since consumer drones are small and tend to fly at low altitudes, they can be difficult to detect by radar. If an unauthorized drone encroaches too close to the restricted airspace, a jammer is triggered which interferes with the droneâ€™s radio signal. It should be noted that it is illegal for private companies to take physical action against drones or interfere with the GPS signal.
