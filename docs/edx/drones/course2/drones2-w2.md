Earthquakes

Factors that Affect Structural Damage for Earthquakes

* Intensity and duration of the vibrations
* Nature of the material on which the structure is built
* Design of the structure


Drones can provide a fast and safe way to scan for potential hazards and people and can cover larger areas much faster than ground teams.

Drones and Disaster Response & Relief

* Hazardous Chemical Spill Monitoring
* Visual Imaging & 3D Mapping
* Assessing Structural Damage
* Delivering Emergency Infrastructures and Supplies
* Wildfire Management


Which FOUR of the following are UAS applications for earthquake hazards?

* geological mapping
* aftershock modeling
* infrastructure surveying
* reconstruction planning 


The three main categories of volcanoes are:

* **Subduction** – one plate dips beneath another and then melts into magma; 
* **Rift** – two plates move away from each other allowing magma to rise; and 
* **Hotspot** – a plate develops a weak spot allowing the magma to push through. 

Volcanoes are further categorized based on their shape and composition. The main types are:

* Cinder cones (lava through a single vent)
* Composite volcano (or Stratovolcano)
* Shield volcano
* Lava dome


UAS Applications in Volcanoes   

Drones are not depicted in the image above, but they are now a key tool used in the monitoring of volcanic activity. 

To measure volcanic gases in remote areas of Kīlauea

Which of the following three activities can UAS help with regarding volcano hazards? Check the three answers that apply.

* Measure volcanic gases
* Assess volcano collapse patterns
* Relay data to emergency managers 

Likewise, one of the typical challenges with natural disasters is the loss of communication infrastructures such as the collapsing of cell towers and downed power lines.

Loss of Communications Means It Becomes:

* Difficult to identify or locate persons in danger
* Difficult to prioritize one response over another
* Difficult to coordinate response


Hydrologic hazards: Floods, hurricanes, tornadoes,  wildfires, and droughts


UAS applications to natural disaster preparedness and response:


* Forecasting, remote sensing, and scanning
* Command and control; situational awareness
* Emergency response; search and rescue
* Disaster recovery operations including damage surveys and reconnaissance


Drones can be used to:

* Forecast **hurricance** path and intensity
* **Volcano** monitoring which include forecasting and predicitin lava flow.
* During **forest fires**. They monitor the fire with IR cameras and predict future burn aresas

UAVs were used temporarily as cell towers during Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017.

* Search times can be significantly reduced while limiting potential risk.
* Drones can cover wide areas before the foot search team can get started.
* Thermal imaging is a major positive for search and rescue.
* Infrared camera can locate body heat in the dark, in areas of dense foliage & under the rubble.
* Forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras detect emitted infrared or thermal radiation & put together a video image with assembled data.


**Search-and-rescue** operations  need to operate in complicated environments, among rubble and wreckage. 
For example, a **drone** can detect open space, avoid obstacles, and build a 3D map of the environment. 
This is very important for search-and-rescue operators to locate victims. 

Drones equipped with infrared thermal imaging cameras are used to find people

Drones can cover large areas much faster than ground crews and deploy much more quickly.

Overhead spotlights can be placed on drones and used during night operations to illuminate the surface.

Other examples include delivery of relief supplies including food, non-food, health, emergency, and shelter materials.

There are a variety of ways the UAVs can capture the damage patterns and produce 2D or 3D maps to estimate area and volume of destruction or changes in geographical conditions such as washed out shorelines, road situations after landslides and floods. 

Drones proved to have the advantage to perform detailed inspections especially in densely populated areas where helicopters had restricted access. 

Local utility companies such as Duke Energy Corporation and Southern Company deployed drones equipped with infrared and high-zoom sensors that inspected substations and located damaged solar panels.

It uses data collected by drones to analyze poor performing areas for farmers to investigate. It can also diagnose problems caused by disease, pests, and a lack of water or nutrients.



 This saves time and reduces physical risks for insurance agents. In 2018, Travelers invested $3 million in Kittyhawk, a drone operations software company. Kittyhawk has supported the growth of Travelers’ drone operation and managed the vast amounts of information by streamlining the data, hardware, and software into one single system of record. A drone can survey damage in real-time and relay the information to claims agents’ phones, tablets or any device with an internet connection.

Drones have become a new tool for geospatial data collection in comparison to traditional data acquisition approaches.

 As a pre-disaster activity, drone following the stream of rivers can control the state of dams.

Man-made hazards are typically comprised of:

* transportation-related
* chemical
* radiological
* nuclear hazards 

Originate from:

* technological
* industrial conditions
* dangerous procedures 
* infrastructure failures
* specific human activities

 Examples include: 
 
 * industrial pollution
 * ionizing radiation
 * toxic wastes
 * dam failures
 * transport accidents
 * factory explosions
 * fires
 * chemical spills

 UAS Applications in Man-made Disasters

  * provide situational awareness
  * conduct search-and-rescue (SAR) operations
  * help determine the best recovery options

  Drones equipped with onboard highly accurate sampling sensors can transmit live stream telemetry data to a ground operator.

  Emerging air quality sensors are having an emerging role in better characterizing levels of air pollution in a variety of settings. A new generation of inexpensive sensors can potentially be loaded on drones to monitor and better study the spatial and temporal variability of pollutants. Sensor networks will provide highly accurate data in estimating the human health impacts of pollutants. 

  Drone Mitigation & Infrastructure Inspections: 

    Might avert man-made disasters, or diminish the severity of forthcoming disasters. UAS inspection of infrastructure, terrain or water can avert man-made disasters.
    Can safely assess ground conditions using remote sensors without putting ground and air inspectors at risk.
    Can efficiently collect data, perform preventative maintenance at lower costs, and cover broader areas in a much shorter time.
    Imagery helps identify new and unique hazards that might go undetected without low-cost, high accuracy aerial imagery.

    * Small drones to exercise and develop SAR techniques

Data management is an increasing challenge as commercial drones and applications evolve. For example, during the disaster response phase of Hurricane Harvey in Houston Texas, approximately 120 UAS flights combined with many more manned aircraft flights resulting in an overload of 2.7 terabytes of data.

Drones help with measuring stockpile volume and provide digital orthophoto mapping of the minefields. There is great potential for aerial measurement, monitoring, and maintenance to increase the efficiency of standard mining operations and provide situational awareness for potential calamities such as collapse, landslide, and toxic gas releases.


 HAZMATs include such substances as toxic chemicals, fuels, nuclear waste products, and biological, chemical, and radiological agents.  They can be released as liquids, solids, gases, or a combination or form of all three, including dust, fumes, gas, vapor, mist, and smoke.
