    A typical Wi-Fi has a range limit of 100 meters.
    This is not sufficient when we are talking about, for example,
    high speed drones, right? So what we're doing here is we're having the Directional Antenna
    that can extend the distance significantly. So the key thing in our
    testbed is the directional antenna, and also the heading control.
    And these two work together to be able to extend the distance to up to
    five kilometers. So this would be very useful in for instance, disaster scenarios
    when the cell tower is gone, so there is no communication infrastructure.
    However, you know, in order to enable information dissemination, the coordination among
    the rescue teams and the control centers, we have to have a structure available to
    make all of this happen. And this is what we're trying to provideâ€¦When we use
    directional antennas there's the key challenge. The key challenge is that
    when the directions are not aligned, the communication is flawed. So when the drones
    are moving or there's a big wind or things like that, the communication
    can be easily disrupted, so what we have here is a directional control that can
    self-align the directions of the antennas to make sure
    that the antennas on different drones can be aligned to establish
    the communication link. I have a project from NSF cyber-physical systems on the
    next generation aviation system, so the purpose is how to manage
    flaws to increase the safety and efficiency of the next generation aviation. We cannot
    rely all the communications through the ground or satellite, so if we can have
    this technology development for the drone- to-drone or fly-to-fly communication
    we can have better sensing, and better coordination, and better safety.
