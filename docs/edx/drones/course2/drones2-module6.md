Welcome to Module 6, the final module of course two. As we have learned throughout the course,
advances in commercial and hobbyist drones have been primarily due to the infusion of
the commercial-off-the-shelf or COTS technologies and innovative applications by a broad spectrum
of the public, private and commercial sectors. This trend will continue in the future with
emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, algorithms, data analytics, 5th generation
or 5G mobile communications, migration to the Cloud, and increased use of accelerated
production 3D printers. This will bring about the development of truly autonomous systems
which are self-thinking machines that wonâ€™t require human control. As autonomy advances,
we will see significant development in drone swarms and the expansion of the counter-UAS
market. The technologies will also reduce manpower costs and increase overall drone
capabilities. We hope that you enjoyed course two and increased your knowledge of emergency
management and how expanded drone applications continue to save lives and help manage the
risks of natural and manmade hazards.

5G Integration 

* Enable better use of the radio spectrum providing more stable connections, quicker data download and upload speeds, and wider coverage.
* Expected to reduce the current latency time to milliseconds.
* Allows nearly instantaneous connection for larger amounts of data across more devices, including virtual reality and artificial intelligence tools.
* First cellular network built to accommodate data trzansmission between devices such as robots, drones, and driver-less cars meaning less human intervention.


5G Networks and Drones

* Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) communications
* Serve as central communications system or a backup to private networks
* Faster integration of drone systems into public and private sectors
* Improved connectivity and lower latency
* Greater precision in maneuvering and quick transfer of high-precision data
* More autonomous drone operations with swarms intra-communicating via 5G
* Navigate using programmed waypoints and not rely on GPS
* Provide secure, encrypted and robust data links with multi-user dissemination
