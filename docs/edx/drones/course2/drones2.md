Drones in Risl Management Process and Memergency:

* Mitigation
* Preparedness
* Response
* Recovery


UAS Support to Emergency Response Operations


* Drones provide invaluable on-scene information for emergency responders
* Drones are changing how insurance companies inspect damaged & flooded 
infrastructure
* Drones had a prominent presence in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma 
& Maria
* An important tool for quicker, more accurate responses with lifesaving 
benefits
* Used by oil & energy companies to inspect damage to fuel tanks, power lines, 
& other facilities in Texas after Hurricane Harvey

Drones also have become an important tool in the COVID-19 pandemic response 
including the delivery of supplies to infected areas, enforcing social 
distancing, temperature checks, inspection and broadcast, and disinfecting 
areas (DJI, 2020).

(DoD Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap)

Disasters are quantified by the number of lives lost, injuries sustained, property destroyed or lost, environmental impact, and ability to recover. International organizations have termed a subset of disasters as humanitarian crises.



Humanitarian Crises

* When a stricken population reaches its capacity to deal with the consequences of a hazard
* Result leads to further loss of life
* Crises events include starvation, disease or plague, lack of shelter, or steady loss of life from the same hazard


KC1.1 Question 1
**Drones** have become an integral part of lifesaving operations around the world in delivering life jackets, emergency supplies, communication devices, medicine or rescue ropes. (Fill in the blanks)
correct.

KC1.1 Question 2
**False**: The terms hazard and disaster are identical and can be used interchangeably.

KC1.1 Question 3
**True**: Most disasters are rapid-onset disasters.

KC1.1 Question 4
Disasters can be classified according to which of the following? (Select the four that apply.)

* Their family
* Precipitating event
* Perilousness
* Their duration

KC1.1 Question 5
**True**: Not all adverse events are disasters, only those that overwhelm response capacity.

Not all disasters result from a single hazard. It is very common for a secondary hazard to cause more damage and loss of life. 

Types of Primary Hazards

* Natural Hazards: severe weather and storms
* Human-Induced Hazards: chemical, microbiological, physical and allergens
* Mixed (Natural and Human-Caused) Hazards




Q1 Question 1
**False**: The terms hazard and disaster are identical and can be used interchangeably.

Q1 Question 2
True or False: Risk management process is limited to identifying risks and their occurrence patterns.

Q1 Question 3 
**False**: Most disasters occur as a result of a single hazard rather than a combination of hazards.

Q1 Question 4 

Q1 Question 5

Q1 Question 8 
**True**: Disaster relief is concerned with timely humanitarian assistance to those affected by a disaster.


 Risk is a composite term that encompasses the uncertainty and the conditions that lead to a loss event.

    Risk = Probability x Vulnerability x Consequences


emergency management

* mitigation/protection
* preparedness
* response
* recovery

5 mission areas

* prevention/protection
* mitigation
* response 
* recovery


Quantitative risk assessment known as Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) is only used when historical data is available to predict the future occurrences of a disastrous event.

 A qualitative assessment based on scientific methods and expert knowledge can help predict the loss event and help mitigate the occurrence or consequences.

Prevention

Prevention consists of actions that reduce the risk of man-made (or human-caused incidents), primarily terrorism. Prevention planning can also help mitigate secondary or opportunistic incidents that may occur after the primary incident.

Mitigation

Mitigation focuses on the impact of a hazard, encompasses the structural and non-structural approaches taken to eliminate or limit a hazard’s presence, people's exposure, or interactions with people, property, and the environment.

Response

Following an incident, response operations reduce the physical, psychological, social, and economic effects of an incident.

Recovery

Recovery encompasses both short-term and long-term efforts for the rebuilding and revitalization of affected communities. Recovery planning builds stakeholder partnerships that lead to community restoration and future sustainability and resiliency.


 KC1.3 Question 1

**True**: Risk encompasses the uncertainty plus the conditions that lead to a loss event.

 KC1.3 Question 2

**True**: The outcome of a risky event can be either positive or negative.

KC1.3 Question 3 
**False**: One can easily quantify the probabilities of occurrence of adverse events.

KC1.3 Question 4

**False**: Risk management process is limited to identifying risks and their occurrence patterns.

KC1.3 Question 5
Low-lying communities along the Atlantic have high-risk **exposure**

Question 7

Which of the following lists show the phases of emergency management in the correct order? (Check the three that apply.)

* Mitigation, Preparedness, Response, Recovery correct 
* Response, Recovery, Mitigation, Preparedness correct
* Recovery, Mitigation, Preparedness, Response


Drone Use Key Points:

* Limits exposure and reduces risk to pilots and wildland firefighters
* Able to fly when manned aircraft unable 
* Limits cost: platform, IR sensor package & aircrew salaries 
* Mobile, easily packable & able to fly in remote locations

How do you believe UAS could contribute to the prediction, preparation, response, and recovery related to this type of hazard or disaster? What do you perceive as the benefits of drones for this use, and what do you believe would be detrimental and/or limiting?  Finally, if you have observed drones or UAS used in these operations, please share your experience. 

I totally agree that the UAS  can help significantly the emergency management:

Prediction - The UAS could work mainly on data collect,
monitoring the environments, that can help alert systems to forecast disaster and identify hazards situations.

Preparation - The US could help to map and delimiter hazard areas.

Response - THe UAS could help the rescue operations
and delivery basic survives itens, like medicaments and foods. 

Recovery - The UAS could help to monitoring and identify
regions that needing attention to be recovered.

For Drone appl, the The main benefits are: low cost,
low hazard exposure time for combat disaster team.

For my region the The limitations is the UAS tecnology acess.



Review 
Use of unmanned aircraft systems is expanding rapidly around the world. Public safety agencies and emergency managers are successfully using UAS technology to assist in emergency management including disaster relief, wildfire combat, and structural damage assessment. Drones with AI capability will be a complementary tool providing extensive information for emergency responders. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, an average of 10,000 wildfires have burned 430,000 acres in the conterminous U.S. within the past 10 years.

The need for UAS' will persist and expand. The UAS will continue to be a force multiplier in managing risk and emergency management of disasters. As part of emergency management planning, in the United States, drones will need to operate within FAA  Temporary Flight Restrictions to operate beyond visual line of sight for the foreseeable future. This longer endurance will provide incident commanders in the emergency management sector with extensive near real-time access to critical information for situational awareness and improved technical capability, safety, and savings.




* There is an increasing pattern in the occurrence of and loss from disasters across the globe.
* Hazards can be natural or man-made. They turn into disasters when the extent of human suffering gets extensive and exceeds local capability.
* Managing risks, emergencies, and disasters is an art and a science. Emergency Management is becoming an established discipline.
* The UAS will continue to be a force multiplier in managing risk and emergency management of disasters.
* Drones will need to operate within FAA Temporary Flight Restrictions to operate beyond visual line of sight for the foreseeable future. 
* Longer endurance will provide incident commanders in the emergency management sector with extensive near real-time access to critical information for situational awareness and improved technical capability, safety, and savings.
