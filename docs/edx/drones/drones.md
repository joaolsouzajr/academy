UAS rely on [global positioning system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU_pY2sTwTA)(GPS) for navigation.


## Sensors and Payloads

* The primary payload on a commercial drone is the onboard camera. When higher quality images are needed, a separate camera can be mounted as a payload. This can be a gyro-stabilized camera that provides balanced images even when the drone is experiencing in-flight turbulence due to wind disturbances
* Wireless Communications Transceivers allow a drone to serve as a signal relay in situations where either a direct ground-to-ground signal isn't practical or provides a capability for a  drone to serve as an interim flying cell tower.
* Drone sensors can be used to measure atmospheric and ground-level conditions. Examples:
    * Infrared sensors can identify hot spots in forest fires at ground level;
    * Ground moisture sensors can be used for agricultural applications;
    * To inspect the infrastructure of oil refineries;

* Delivery systems are being used experimentally in delivering medical supplies to remote locations in rural areas of some countries.


What's happening is our technology is advancing to the point where our sensors are becoming?

    higher performance in a smaller package. And what that means is longer airtime

    There are other technologies that are coming to us that are more accurate such as LiDAR,
    optical flow sensors. We have sonar sensors, which have some limitations.

innovation now with sensors to make them smaller, more capable,

to reduce the amount of data that it's actually required to contain the information that they're gathering and then the processing end.
Some of the processing now is looking to be done onboard the aircraft to reduce how much you have to send back via the pipeline,
back to a ground control station. So there's a lot of work being done in that processing field of machine learning.

So sensor work, payload work,
the lot of effort going into that area because that really is
what people should focus on. Everybody focuses on the shiny object,
the shiny toy. It has nothing to do with the shiny toy.
What it has to do with is what do you need the shiny toy to do? And that's data.
And even more so, data into information, into knowledge, into decision making power. That's where you need to start is
what is the decision you need to make? Work your way back to the aircraft.


## Power Sources

For applications requiring longer endurance and vertical takeoff and landing, standard fixed-wing aircraft are currently the optimum configuration.

Multi-rotor

* Advantage

    * You also have the ability to stop and hover.
    * So your sensors are able to cover an area, stay on an area, really get that stare on a particular area and keep track of it.
    * They also have the ability to fly over targets

* Disadvantage
    * They use a lot of power. 
    * They're not very efficient. 
    * They don't glide at all.
    * So there's no aerodynamic advantage.
    * They have to constantly keep rotating the props just to stay airborne. So that's one big disadvantage of them.
    * The software is a little more complex because you have to control all of the rotors to achieve the flight. It's not innately difficult, it's just complex. So you have to

Fixed-wing

* Advantage

    * The big advantage is you have the endurance because it's very efficient.
    * Your power lasts longer. All might allow you to fly for two hours in a fixed-wing aircraft.

* Disadvantage

    * You don't have as much flexibility geographically. You need some flat, straight line distance to do your takeoff and landings. It might be very short.
    * You could need thousands of feet of
    runway or prepared surface to be able to get it in and out of its operating environment.

VTOL (Vertical take-off and langing) / hybrid

* Take advantage of both of those worlds.
* They get the advantage of the vertical takeoff and landing but with the forward flight efficiencies.
* The hybrid attempts to take the best of both of those two with a very small, very efficient gas engine
that would create an electrical energy - get better power density out of the amount of fuel
you're carrying to be able to turn it into that electrical energy. 

Eletrical

* Advnatagens
    * It's very convenient. You swap batteries in and out. So it's a user ease kind of thing
    * that's very clean until you have a problem with the battery
* Disvantages

Gas

* Advnatagens
    * they can be very efficient for the weight. You can have very efficient
* Disvantages
    * it does have that fuel aspect and there's a somewhat of a noise aspect
    * You also have to be able to carry all the fuel so there is still a weight


## Communications

Look the requirements

* What do you need to do with the signal?
* Is it a high bandwidth, high data rate, signal?
* Is it something that can be stored on the aircraft and downloaded via an SD card later?
* What kind of range do you need?
* What kind of power do you need?
* What kind of spectrum do you have availability for?
