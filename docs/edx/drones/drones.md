UAS rely on [global positioning system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU_pY2sTwTA)(GPS) for navigation.


## Sensors and Payloads

* The primary payload on a commercial drone is the onboard camera. When higher quality images are needed, a separate camera can be mounted as a payload. This can be a gyro-stabilized camera that provides balanced images even when the drone is experiencing in-flight turbulence due to wind disturbances
* Wireless Communications Transceivers allow a drone to serve as a signal relay in situations where either a direct ground-to-ground signal isn't practical or provides a capability for a  drone to serve as an interim flying cell tower.
* Drone sensors can be used to measure atmospheric and ground-level conditions. Examples:
    * Infrared sensors can identify hot spots in forest fires at ground level;
    * Ground moisture sensors can be used for agricultural applications;
    * To inspect the infrastructure of oil refineries;

* Delivery systems are being used experimentally in delivering medical supplies to remote locations in rural areas of some countries.


What's happening is our technology is advancing to the point where our sensors are becoming?

    higher performance in a smaller package. And what that means is longer airtime

    There are other technologies that are coming to us that are more accurate such as LiDAR,
    optical flow sensors. We have sonar sensors, which have some limitations.

innovation now with sensors to make them smaller, more capable,

to reduce the amount of data that it's actually required to contain the information that they're gathering and then the processing end.
Some of the processing now is looking to be done onboard the aircraft to reduce how much you have to send back via the pipeline,
back to a ground control station. So there's a lot of work being done in that processing field of machine learning.

So sensor work, payload work,
the lot of effort going into that area because that really is
what people should focus on. Everybody focuses on the shiny object,
the shiny toy. It has nothing to do with the shiny toy.
What it has to do with is what do you need the shiny toy to do? And that's data.
And even more so, data into information, into knowledge, into decision making power. That's where you need to start is
what is the decision you need to make? Work your way back to the aircraft.


## Power Sources

For applications requiring longer endurance and vertical takeoff and landing, standard fixed-wing aircraft are currently the optimum configuration.

Multi-rotor

* Advantage

    * You also have the ability to stop and hover.
    * So your sensors are able to cover an area, stay on an area, really get that stare on a particular area and keep track of it.
    * They also have the ability to fly over targets

* Disadvantage
    * They use a lot of power. 
    * They're not very efficient. 
    * They don't glide at all.
    * So there's no aerodynamic advantage.
    * They have to constantly keep rotating the props just to stay airborne. So that's one big disadvantage of them.
    * The software is a little more complex because you have to control all of the rotors to achieve the flight. It's not innately difficult, it's just complex. So you have to

Fixed-wing

* Advantage

    * The big advantage is you have the endurance because it's very efficient.
    * Your power lasts longer. All might allow you to fly for two hours in a fixed-wing aircraft.

* Disadvantage

    * You don't have as much flexibility geographically. You need some flat, straight line distance to do your takeoff and landings. It might be very short.
    * You could need thousands of feet of
    runway or prepared surface to be able to get it in and out of its operating environment.

VTOL (Vertical take-off and langing) / hybrid

* Take advantage of both of those worlds.
* They get the advantage of the vertical takeoff and landing but with the forward flight efficiencies.
* The hybrid attempts to take the best of both of those two with a very small, 
very efficient gas engine that would create an electrical energy - get better 
power density out of the amount of fuel you're carrying to be able to turn it 
into that electrical energy. 

Eletrical

* Advnatagens
    * It's very convenient. You swap batteries in and out. So it's a user ease 
    kind of thing
    * that's very clean until you have a problem with the battery
* Disvantages

Gas

* Advnatagens
    * they can be very efficient for the weight. You can have very efficient
* Disvantages
    * it does have that fuel aspect and there's a somewhat of a noise aspect
    * You also have to be able to carry all the fuel so there is still a weight


## Communications

Look the requirements

* What do you need to do with the signal?
* Is it a high bandwidth, high data rate, signal?

* This power system provides versatility and economy for small drones.  
* The down side of electric batteries is their relatively low energy-to-weight ratio.

Fuel cells can store a vast amount of energy but are limited in their peak power output.

Electric power is especially useful in quadcopters which use multiple fixed pitch rotors with rapid speed adjustments to power and control drone flight.


Gas Powered Drone Benefits

Endurance and Range are key in the operational capability and performance of 
different types of UAVs. ENDURENCE is maximum flight time and RANGE is maximum 
distance the UAV can travel on a single flight. Both are interrelated and 
determined by the aircraft’s speed. (Complete this sentence by selecting the 
words in appropriate order below.)


COTS applications have improved the operational and mission capabilities of the following sectors:

* Law enforcement surveillance
* Maritime drug interdiction
* Border enforcement
* Real estate sales



Into the system ahead of time or possibly real-time and then the aircraft just 
follows those points. The next step beyond automated is automation.
Where now the aircraft is starting to perform functions that are 
pre-programmed, but it's executing them on their -
its own based on a timeline or based on certain responses that it's getting

Whereas a fully autonomous system is going to be self-contained from takeoff to landing and all risk
mitigation in between.

Onboard electronic control systems:

* Provide specific commands to navigate the aircraft
* Other onboard control machinery is used to control power plants
* Control other ancillary components such as:
    * wireless communications systems for aircraft control.
    * Manage the activities of payloads: sensors, cameras, and dispensers.

Aircraft control systems convert navigation signals from either a remote controller or an on-board navigation system into commands to steer the aircraft directionally up-down, side-to-side and turning left or right. 

Autonomous aircraft navigation systems use a variety of sensors designed to establish the aircraft’s location, and direction, so navigation decisions can be made based on pre-programmed routes and responsive algorithms guided by artificial intelligence (AI).


Infused from autonomous guidance technologies:

* Even small quadcopters are equipped with accelerometers, gyroscopes, and a  compass for navigation.


In the energy sector, drones can be used to inspect transmission towers, storm restoration surveys, ground patrols, and site development and construction.


Many types of autonomous technologies have migrated from military applications using artificial intelligence algorithms with:

* Optical sensors to track and follow features for terrain avoidance based on  
pre-programmed routes.
* Navigation sensors to include accelerometers and gyroscopes to navigate the 
vehicle.
* On board electronic control systems to control power plants, and wireless 
communications to multiple payloads such as sensors, cameras and dispensers.
* On-board processing to analyze accumulated data and provide real-time aerial 
images and maps to multiple locations. 


LIDAR Data Collection

* Emission of laser pulse
* Record backscattered signal
* Measure the time of flight x speed of light
* Calculate platform position & altitude
* Compute precise echo position
* Used to produce 3D images


 Lithium-ion batteries  are currently the best solution for 
 high-power-and-energy applications. One of the most important new 
 technologies will be in a light weight, long- lasting battery power source 
 that would enable drones to fly for hours instead of minutes.

**The strategic direction for the military and commercial drone markets is 
autonomy**. The next generation of drones will have more efficient motors, 
better onboard processors and software, more accurate sensors and built-in 
compliance technology for safe, effective flight control. 

The strategic direction for the military and commercial drone markets is autonomy.

* The next generation of drones will have more efficient motors.
* The next generation of drones will have better on-board processors and 
software.
* The next generation of drones will have more accurate sensors and built-in 
compliance technology for safe, effective flight control.
* The next generation of drones will have the ability to transmit real-time 
data.

Drones will operate within a UAS traffic management (UTM) system for 
low-altitude airspace flight to ensure UAS don’t collide into buildings, 
airplanes or one another. This UTM system would:

* Provide continuous communication, navigation and surveillance
* Provide warning and direction of drones of congestion or severe weather.
* Enable automated delivery of goods, emergency services, and industrial and 
agricultural applications.
* Allow UAS operations to safely expand to scale and integrate into the 
national air space. 


The fifth-generation network, commonly known as the 5G network technology will 
serve as an information conduit for drones over an ultra-high-speed, low 
latency connection. Identify the advantages of this 5G evolution:

* A wireless communication systems with greater bandwidth and connectivity, 
and improved network coverage.
* Allow for a greater precision in maneuvering, the quick transfer of 
high-precision data, and back up communication infrastructure.
* Enable drones to always stay connected with immense precision, and much 
higher reliability for beyond line of sight operations.
* More autonomous drone operations with drone swarms communicating with each  
other and sending real-time data between the networked systems. 

To summarize, we learned that the endurance and range of a drone are key 
determinants for application to specific tasks. The most common power source 
for small drones is the battery-driven electric motor, which provides 
versatility and economy. Longer endurance drones use a gas powered internal 
combustion engine. A drone’s payload capacity is limited by its 
weight-carrying capability. The most common use of drones is to carry sensors, 
and the most common sensor is the optical camera. Wireless capability provides 
many methods of communicating from a remote controller to a drone. GPS is the 
primary navigation tool used in drones of various sizes and a breakthrough 
critical technology. The integration of drone technology is wide-ranging and 
limitless due to COTS applications which reduces development time and cost. 
One of the most important future technologies will be in power sources.

One remaining challenge confronting the drone industry is privacy. Many drones 
are equipped with cameras and other surveillance gear. There is little to 
prevent private individuals have them buzz past bedroom windows and peeking 
over fences. There are questions over how the police may use them too, and how 
this would impact privacy.

Drones will become more mainstreamed in the near future. There are still many 
challenges that require technological and process solutions specifically in 
safety and privacy issues. Emerging technologies will pave the way for faster 
integration of drone systems into various industries, and increasing the ease 
and efficiency of certain functions. Over the next few years, drone technology 
will provide safer, more autonomous and quieter drones, as they gain 
capabilities that will impact our daily lives.
