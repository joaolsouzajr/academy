The U.S. Office of Naval Research’s Perdix micro drone test resulted in a breakthrough for **autonomy** and **swarms** and demonstrated advanced swarm behaviors such as collective decision-making and adaptive formation flying. (Select the set of words that accurately completes the sentence.)


C-UAS technologies have significant limitations at airports as was demonstrated at the UK’s Gatwick and Heathrow airports in 2019. Read the following statements describing existing C-UAS limitations and select the three statements that are true.

* Airports have numerous sources of potential interference such as high radio spectrum congestion.
* Jamming drones near airports can cause problems by jamming aviation frequencies used by airport radio communication and navigation transmitters.
* The coverage distance for many types of C-UAS detection technologies can be constrained in identifying the locations of drones. 


There is a major concern that weaponized drones will proliferate beyond the battlefields of Syria and Iraq and create an asymmetric threat by terrorist groups. This threat could be the use of weaponized COTS hobbyist for:

Targeting and surveillance.
Kinetic attacks.
Situational awareness.
Command and control. 

**True**: The focus of the C-UAS industry is to create effective detection and negation systems for the military and commercial sectors but common industry standards are required to improve reliability and establish successful processes and procedures.

The C-UAS industry has increased significantly throughout the world. Counter UAS capability is primarily designed for **airspace security**  in the commercial and civilian sectors in order to detect, identify and interdict unauthorized breaches.

As commercial and hobbyist drones become increasingly popular, unauthorized and malicious have increased and drones are being used for malicious purposes such as illegal surveillance and smuggling contraband into penitentiaries. The counter drone industry is evolving with a variety of technologies and capabilities. Which three of the following are considered successful C-UAS techniques?

* Radio Frequency jamming to disrupt communication and navigation links.
* Passive techniques such as signs warning of unauthorized drone operations.
* Spotlights and loud speakers warning drones to stay away.
