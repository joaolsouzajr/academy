Terms:

* **Drone** is an inexact term which can refer to any unmanned 
vehicle.The robots and remote-controlled vehicles are occasionally 
referred to as drones.
* **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)** is an aircraft remotely operated by a pilot 
located at a ground control station.
* **An Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)** is the unmanned aircraft and the 
associated support equipment, control station, data links, telemetry, 
communications, and navigation equipment that is necessary to operate the 
unmanned aircraft.
* **Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS)**, the FAA defines the small UAS as an unmanned aircraft weighing less than 55 pounds.

Critical drone technologies include:

    Navigation
    Sensors
    Communications

 KC1.1 Question 1

Compare UAS and UAV. Which of the following statements is **INCORRECT**?

* UAS refers to the overall system surrounding the UAV. The UAV is an individual 
vehicle, known as a drone, within the system.
* UAV are designed for consumers (hobbyists, photographers, etc.). UAS are 
designed for commercial use and the military.
* UAS are unmanned and may also be referred to as a drone. UAV are remotely 
manned by a pilot on the ground.
