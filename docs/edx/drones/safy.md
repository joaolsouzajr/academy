    [Tony Pucciarella, Director of Operations, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Test Site, University of Maryland] With key technologies moving forward, I think
    one of the big barriers right now to unmanned aircraft - that is people will lump it into the
    area of airspace integration, but it really comes down to detect and avoid or sense and avoid.
    It's called both DAA or SAA and what that means is we have to be able to fly these aircraft
    around manned aircraft. So it's an integrative manned/unmanned aircraft environment that we need to be able to operate in to do
    these urban missions to do these,
    you know, to fly your medical supplies in an urban environment over people.
    And we have to be able to do that with manned aircraft because they're not going away and we need them to do their mission.
    So detect and avoid is the technology where the aircraft has to be able to -
    the unmanned aircraft - has to detect manned aircraft and then be able to relay that
    information down to the remote pilot, so that they can make corrective actions to avoid from hitting them.
    So that has been one of the big technology
    study
    programs over the last 10 years.
    I worked on that with the Navy as part of their Triton program and their detect and avoid or sense and avoid program and
    their mantra was they had to be - their requirement was - they had to be able to operate in
    every environment pretty much around the world and they need to be able to do that safely.
    And the only way to do that was through a sense and avoid system.
    And, you know, there's been technologies looking at, you know, small radars
    electro-optical,
    acoustic, and some of those have worked well in certain environments and others don't work well in those environments.
    So what I'm saying is kind of a hybrid solution
    with multiple sensors and using existing
    technologies to be able to create a picture to the remote pilot so that they can integrate themselves
    safely into the manned aircraft environment. And I think that's got to be solved.
    I mean besides that and the other one would be reliability - to be able to fly over people requires that you have a
    system that is safe. And when you look at reliability with unmanned aircraft -
    I call them flying bundles of single point failures.
    If you take - from the battery, to the ESC (electronic speed controller), to the motor, to the prop, on a small quadcopter like a DJI Phantom or something -
    and I'm not trying to target DJI -
    but there are, each one of those, if that, if any one of those components fails, the aircraft falls out of the sky.
    You've got four of those on a quadcopter - four of those mini systems on a quadcopter.
    So if any one of those things fails, it falls out of the sky. And there's lots of other single point failuers where in manned aviation
    we're focused on, you know, redundant and sometimes triple redundant systems. The unmanned - because of one, trying to keep things small and the battery
    technology doesn't allow us to fly as long as we would like to -
    there's limitations there. And so you can't put a lot of redundant systems on a small aircraft, but we have to be able to
    predict if that aircraft is going to be able to fly over people safely and it's not going to fall out of the sky.
    You know, we've had issues here where things have just stopped working.
    You know, just literally, the power distribution board on one of the aircraft just stopped and all four motors failed. So we don't fly over
    people unless we - it can actually do it and show that we can do it safely.
    But I think between detect and avoid or sense and avoid, it's called, depending on the realm that you're in. It's called both.
    To where that's going to help us integrate into the manned environment, which is a requirement and then the reliability so that we can do
    those missions safely over people in urban environments.
    I think those are the two most critical technologies that the COTS community is helping us solve as well as military inputs.
