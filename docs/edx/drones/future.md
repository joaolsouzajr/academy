    [Tony Pucciarella, Director of Operations, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Test Site, University of Maryland] Drones, I think will play a major role in everybody's life. I told my kids, you know,
    their kids will probably see when they're flying on an airline -
    they'll probably see a large unmanned aircraft fly underneath them or fly
    near them. We're gonna get the safety to that level. We're not there yet.
    Nobody's comfortable with that yet. But eventually we will get there. But there
    are certain technologies that I think will feed that and I think that, as
    I mentioned before, with detect and avoid and reliability - those are two of them.
    But I do see in the next few years, as we start to solve some of those hard
    problems, and they are difficult problems, I think once we solve those and the
    process issue of being, how do we procedurally put them in the same airspace with manned aircraft?
    [Matt Scassero, Director, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Test Site, University of Maryland] So the future of unmanned technology across the
    board, but specifically within aviation, has a lot of challenges, but also a lot
    of promise. And our goal as a research Test Site, but also our goal as humanity,
    really is to stay ahead of it. What are the things that we want unmanned systems
    to do? What are the things that we want AI [Artificial Intelligence] to do? And automation and autonomy to
    do? Versus, where we do not want them to be? Where don't we want to let them to run
    rampant and run our lives for us? Where can they benefit us, but not take over us?
    So as far as the real nuts and bolts, where are things going to be
    5, 10, 15 years from now? A lot of that is actually going to come down to
    regulation - at least in the aviation world. On the unmanned ground systems and
    submersibles and things in your home and Roombas and all of that. It really comes
    down to technology. And getting comfortable with technology, and we're
    starting to get used to robotic vacuum cleaners - they're great. But in aviation, it's
    really coming down to regulation. The technology exists today to do over the
    horizon, beyond visual line of sight, flight over people, big aircraft doing all kinds
    of amazing things. The problem is we don't have the regulations in place to
    do it safely, and that's really the driver - is safety. Yes we can do it. Can we
    guarantee it's going to do it every time and not fall out of the sky? No. We can't.
    And that goes back to the single point of failure idea. There's so many single
    points of failure in these aircraft. Even the very large aircraft that we see - the
    BAMs, the Tritons, the Global Hawks. They're based on manned aircraft systems,
    and they do have redundancies and the idea of graceful degradation is
    something that they actually use because they come from that manned aircraft
    background. A lot of these systems come from that RadioShack background where
    they just want to do something cool, that's very effective, but don't worry
    about all that reliability, redundancy stuff. "We'll buy another one." It might be
    great to buy another one, but if it came down on top of a person, or you lost
    control of it over the horizon, and it ended up in the White House lawn. There's issues
    with that. So the biggest limiting factor for the technology in the UAS world is
    really the regulatory environment. Where do we see that going? Right now we have
    Part 107 that authorizes small UAS, 55 pounds and below 400 feet and below, to
    go out there and do a lot of good stuff within visual line of sight, day time. You can
    get waivers to a lot of this stuff to increase your capability. That's the rule
    set that's out there right now and it's going to stay there.
    The next rule set will be things like flight over people, flight beyond visual
    line of sight, and for larger aircraft. At a minimum, those next rule sets are
    probably two to four years away from here where we are in 2018. Not because of
    any technological reasons - it's building the trust, building the understanding,
    building the data of how good are these systems? What is the real reliability
    information? What's the real requirement for redundant systems? Where are the
    standards? We're starting to see groups like ISO - International Standards
    Organization and the ANSI [American National Standards Institute] are starting to roll out standards for unmanned aircraft
    systems. But some of the really critical pieces like detect and avoid, sense and avoid
    DAA and SAA - for that roll into the whole unmanned aircraft system traffic
    management system - which we could go into detail on - those things haven't been set
    yet. They're working on them. But until those are set, those standards are set, we
    can't really apply the technologies to answer those standards, and to be able to
    supply those capabilities. So those regulations are going to be dependent on
    developing the standards and also the expectations. What does humanity - what does
    society wants us to do? Where does society draw the line that we don't want you to
    go there? And then what are the other industries
    that are going to pressure us - manned aircraft industries, airline industries,
    airport industries. Where are they going to draw limits and lines that "We don't
    want you to do this," or "it's uncomfortable," or "it cuts into our
    business"? And now you have one business working against another business. So
    those are the kind of pressures we're going to get. We do envision - crystal ball
    time - we do envision that sometime in the next five years, we're going to have larger
    than 55 pound vehicles. We will have small vehicles flying over people.
    Vehicles with recovery systems like parachutes flying over people. You will
    have systems flying beyond visual line of sight. Those will be limited by somewhat
    geography, by population density, and by technology a little bit. So we do see
    those things happening in the next 5 years. 10 to 15-20 years from now it's
    really anybody's guess as far as what people are going to become comfortable with.
    Again, the technology is probably not going to be a limiting factor because
    the technology quite often exists now. The real quantum leap in capability is,
    as I mentioned earlier, the continuum of capability from unmanned through remote,
    through autonomy, to AI. AI and autonomies is where you really, really take advantage of the
    efficiencies of unmanned systems. When you put the processing power and the
    thinking and the sensing onboard the aircraft, you extend your line of sight.
    You also extend your capability and, in fact, your personality - into however
    you're making that system operate - into other areas. So when you start to see
    those capabilities coming online, especially AI and machine learning, those
    kind of capabilities, that's going to be the game changer. And that could be 10-15
    years or it could be longer depending on again our trust and our ability to
    control the technologies. Because many people don't want to roll those
    technologies out until we're assured that we know exactly how they're going to be
    able to be controlled and where can we draw the limits on those systems?

    [Ryan Henderson, UAS Pilot, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Test Site University of Maryland] Future requirements are going to be largely driven not only by industry, but
    also by the FAA and some of our safety regulations. We're going to have systems
    that are redundant in both power and their control systems - whether it's
    control surface or its propulsion. Control links. All those areas are
    important to have redundancy. I think also industry is also going to start
    driving things such as different power sources - hybrid power sources, solar power
    systems. All those things need to be explored further and refined. And at this
    rate they're coming along really, really quickly.

Intelligent Enterprise (IE) technologies and robotics are being aggressively infused throughout multiple global business sectors. This includes AI, IoT, robotic process automation, machine learning, and data analysis. Drones an even be used to serve as flying data centers to provide efficiency to and significantly help people within the services like construction, agriculture, transportation, law enforcement, and search and rescue operations. The impact of intelligent technological innovation will significantly affect the UAS sector in the next few years but there are still major hurdles to implementation.

    [Music playing.] [Text on screen: Future Capabilities of UAS]
    [Ryan Henderson, UAS Pilot, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Test Site, University of Maryland] Well, I see the use of AI in drones in two different aspects really. We've got
    the payload side of it, where you have a sensor of some sort collecting data, and
    then once we have the data we have to be able to do something with the data.
    Perhaps that AI [artifical intelligence) is trying to find or identify something, or perhaps the AI is
    using that collected data to then send signals and instructions to the
    autopilot to make the aircraft do something, or behave in a different
    manner. Now, on the see and avoid side of AI and
    actual control systems of the aircraft - we may use AI to change the behavior of
    the aircraft based simply on its environment, or perhaps other aircraft in the airspace.
    [Brian E. Powers, Program Chair, Intelligence Management The Graduate School, UMUC] So let's look at a notional example. So looking ahead
    three years from now and we have a VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) hybrid engine drone that also has AI
    software involved with it and it also has beyond visual range with the
    communications. So where is that, with that capability, what we then - what we
    have today, what will we be able to do? [Ryan Henderson, UAS Pilot, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Test Site, University of Maryland] Well, I think that the
    possibilities with that are fairly endless. It could be from data
    acquisition on the ground deliveries. Being able to also have AI talk to and
    understand other aircraft in the area, and not work, necessarily against them,
    but with them. We're going to go far beyond just flying with manned and other
    unmanned aircraft and moving out of each other's way. Instead we're going to use
    AI to make the mission of all aircraft, both cooperative and uncooperative, a
    partnership. 5G connectivity has promised to have tremendous bandwidth - more
    bandwidth than anything we've had in the past.
    Once 5G becomes implemented, I think that that is going to really open a lot of
    doors. Not just for the control of the aircraft, but simply the telemetry
    availability and the high bandwidth that we're going to be able to take back down
    from the air to the ground. Wireless is certainly the way to go, although tethered
    drones have shown their importance and role right now, with first responders,
    communication relays, and surveillance. So there is a place for wired and tethered
    aircraft but wireless is ever-expanding. 5G is going to be great. There's also
    going to be great advances in SATCOM and low-earth orbit satellites, which are
    going to become more available and higher bandwidth. The advances in
    technology everyday are in the end-user's favor. More fail-safes are being built in,
    not only to the hardware, but the software - to allow the user or pilot to
    understand if they are coming into harm's way, or if perhaps the aircraft is
    having an issue. The aircraft is better able to mitigate that risk, and perhaps
    bring the aircraft back home safely.
