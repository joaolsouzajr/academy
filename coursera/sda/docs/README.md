## Moule 1 Object-Oriented Analysis and Desing

### Object-Oriented Thinking

When translated to object-oriented modelling, object-oriented 
thinking involves representing key concepts through objects in your 
software. Note that concepts are broad in nature.

By using objects, the code stays:

* **Organized**
* **Flexible**
* **Reusable**

## Desing in the Software Process

A process is generally iterative. These
iterations consist of taking a set of requirements based on the
identified problem(s) and using them to create **conceptual design*
mock-ups and **technical design** diagrams, which can then be used
to create a working software **implementation**, which must also pass
testing. This process is repeated for each set of requirements,
eventually creating a complete solution for the project.

Interative Process:

* *Requirements*
* **Conceptual desing (mock-ups)**
* **Technical design (diagrams)**
* **Implementation**

Requirements and design activities help you to understand what assumptions you need so that
you create the right product.
